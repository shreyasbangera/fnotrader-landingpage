            <p className="text-gray-600">The www.fnotrader.com is not a trading terminal, the execution of the trade happens on the brokers platform. In this context, it is considered Algorithmic trading, though the users are placing the trades through www.fnotrader.com, they are sent to the exchange, through the Brokers API.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">This is an add-on facility that we provide to ease your process of putting an order with your broker. The company will not be responsible in any manner whatsoever for the losses, profits, revenues, financial losses; lack of connectivity or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages while using the Trade facility in the Application. The company will not be held liable for any expense, loss or damage whatsoever.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">Risks of Engaging in Trading through Trading APIs provided by the Stock Brokerswww.fnotrader.com allows you to engage in live trading using the broker's API access given to you by the broker. Engaging in live trading subjects you to:</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">The risks associated with trading generally, and (b) the risks associated with live trading using brokers trading APIs through www.fnotrader.com.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">Your broker may experience failures in its infrastructure, fail to execute your orders in a correct or timely fashion or reject your orders.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">www.fnotrader.com infrastructure on which you are triggering the trades might fail. In addition, even if www.fnotrader.com infrastructure or your broker's infrastructure and API are working correctly, the orders may get rejected or triggered in error or by design, incorrectly execute orders, or induce errors through unexpected behaviour (such as returning messages out of sequence, incorrectly acknowledging orders, or posting incorrect execution reports). If at all, any losses arise from these risks, the company bears no responsibility for this.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">The system you use for generating orders, communicating those orders to your broker, and receiving queries and trading results from your broker may fail or not function in a correct or timely manner.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">Latency (i.e., delays) within and between your system, between www.fnotrader.com servers and the broker and the exchanges, as well as those of your broker and the exchanges in which you seeking to affect trades, might cause orders, modifications, and cancels to be placed or not placed in ways that are not desired. You may receive incorrect information, or be unable to get information, about your orders, your positions, or market conditions. Incorrect actions may be taken, or correct actions may not be taken, because of inaccurate or missing information.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">Time lag at various points in live trading might cause unexpected behaviour.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">The time lag between placing an order in www.fnotrader.com and the order placed in the system, can cause a delayed order placement in the market, lead to cancellations, and cause you loss (or fail to gain profits) and may deliver unanticipated results vastly different from the back test results.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">The systems of third parties in addition to those of the provider from which we obtain various services, your broker, and the applicable securities market may fail or malfunction.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">Accurate and complete real-time price data is critical for the success of trading and it depends on the Broker's API. The broker's API could experience failures, errors, and latency, which could result in missing, incorrect, or stale market data or entirely broker down.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">Malicious and criminal activities might cause your strategy or strategies to fail, or your brokerage account to be compromised.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">All computers and networks are subject to malicious "hacking" attacks and criminal activities designed to misappropriate intellectual property, compromise personally identifiable information, steal funds, or any combination of such purposes. These attacks might be attacks on a target of opportunity or specifically targeted. Each of the various systems described above that are necessary for you to engage in live algorithmic trading is subject to such attack. Any such attack could cause the system to function improperly or not function at all, and could result in the misappropriation of your intellectual property, the compromise of your personally identifiable information and personal financial information, the theft of your funds and can cause your strategy be misbehave, malfunction or behave erratically.</p>
